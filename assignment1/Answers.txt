Answers to Part 1

1.1) Why does your process read files like ld.so.* when it starts up?
These .so files are "dynamic" or "shared" libraries which are loaded by the process at runtime. The process loads
dynamic libraries to be able to execute functions that are exported by these libraries. For example,
GLibc is loaded as seen here:
open("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
This is the GNU C Library which defines system calls and other core functions such as printf.

1.2) Locale files are used for localization purposes to determine things like which character set to use depending
on the operating system's configuration.

1.3) On my system, this value is 16384 bytes.

stat("default_t.te", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=2371, ...}) = 0
open("default_t.te", O_RDONLY)          = 3
fadvise64(3, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL) = 0
read(3, "\nmodule default_t 1.0;\n\nrequire "..., 16384) = 2371

1.4) The system call exit_group() does not return.
exit_group(0)                           = ?
